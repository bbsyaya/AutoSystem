                voices, a perky rap section from Bora and the breath coos impressive high notes from Hyo Lin.&amp;quot;
                Regarding the music video, they wrote, &amp;quot;While &amp;#039;Touch My Body&amp;#039; was fun for its
                bright colors and whimsical sets, &amp;#039;I Swear&amp;#039; is a treat for its plot,&amp;quot; and
                &amp;quot;Yet for such a frolicsome visual, there are loads of sexy moments peppered throughout the vid
                including many close-ups of the girls&amp;#039; backsides and their bikini bods.&amp;quot; They also
                mentioned that SISTAR did not get rid of their usual sexy concept, and wrote, &amp;quot;The quartet hasn&amp;#039;t

                booty at the opening -- perhaps as an attempt to make it feel like this is a natural part of a

                television comedy &amp;quot;Friends&amp;quot; for 10 years, Jennifer Aniston has spent the last decade
                looking for roles where she can &amp;quot;kick some ass.&amp;quot; In &amp;quot;Life of Crime,&amp;quot;
                out in U.S. Aniston, 45, talked to Reuters about the excitement of being in a caper comedy, playing
                strong female characters and the &amp;quot;Friends&amp;quot; phenomenon 10 years after it concluded its

            <description>(Reuters) - A&amp;E Networks is close to taking a 10 percent stake in Vice Media that would
                value the company at $2.5 billion, a Vice Media spokesman confirmed on Friday. A&amp;E, which is jointly
                owned by Walt Disney Co and media group Hearst Corp, is investing $250 million in Vice Media, which
                started as a Canadian magazine and has ballooned into a multimedia conglomerate known for producing edgy
                videos and news reports. Vice Media Chief Executive Officer Shane Smith told the FT that it is a great
                deal. The potential deal comes not long after Time Warner Inc was reportedly set to invest in Vice with
                the idea of combining it with Time Warner's HLN news network.

                film festival that his character, a born romantic, was attracted to crazy women, but &amp;quot;being
                crazy isn&amp;#039;t always a negative thing.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Crazy in love can sort of be a nice
                thing, in that sense we&amp;#039;re all crazy,&amp;quot; he quipped, before heading off to dazzle
                screaming fans on the red carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description>

                of screwball comedy Peter Bogdanovich charmed audiences at the Venice film festival on Friday with his
                movie &amp;quot;She&amp;#039;s Funny That Way&amp;quot;, a delicious romantic farce with a star-studded
                cast. Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston and Rhys Ifans star in the flick, which centres on a prostitute
                named Izzy (Britain&amp;#039;s Imogen Poots) who dreams of becoming an actress. Izzy get a lucky break
                when she meets a client -- Owen Wilson -- who has a soft spot for helping out women down on their luck.
                An impish Owen, casual in navy trousers and pullover, told journalists at the world&amp;#039;s oldest
                film festival that his character, a born romantic, was attracted to crazy women, but &amp;quot;being
                crazy isn&amp;#039;t always a negative thing.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Crazy in love can sort of be a nice
                thing, in that sense we&amp;#039;re all crazy,&amp;quot; he quipped, before heading off to dazzle
                screaming fans on the red carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text>

        <item><title>TDC and buyout firms vie for Norway's cable operator Get: sources</title>
            <description>By Pamela Barbaglia and Freya Berry LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Norway's second-biggest cable
                operator Get expects to receive binding offers from Denmark's TDC and two heavyweight private equity
                funds in a sale that could value the company at around 1.4 billion euros ($1.84 billion) including debt,
                several sources familiar with the situation said. European private equity firms BC Partners [BCPRT.UL]
                and EQT will table their bids ahead of a deadline of Sept. 11 and will face competition from Danish
                telecoms group TDC, the sources said on Friday. Earlier this year Get's owners, the private equity arm
                of Goldman Sachs and investment firm Quadrangle, hired advisors for a possible stock market floatation
                of Get after the European summer. Representatives of TDC and BC Partners declined to comment.
