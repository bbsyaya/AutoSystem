</div>
<p>Add to this a lack of access to services in rural and regional areas and suddenly the situation for men in country areas is far worse.</p>
<p>Mental Health Week, October 5 to 12, is designed to highlight this issues surrounding mental health, and the need for more public care and understanding.</p>
<p>It's about trying to change attitudes, such as those of many men who believe they should be tough, self-reliant and able to manage pain. This way of thinking makes it difficult for them to acknowledge when they have any health problems, particularly regarding mental health.</p>
<p>But depression is a serious and common condition that won't just disappear. </p>
<p>According to Beyondblue, often the physical symptoms of depression such as feeling tired or losing weight are more obvious in men.</p>
<p>Depression is common, with one in eight men experiencing it at some stage during their life. </p>
<p>Depression is a high risk factor for suicide with approximately 2200 suicides in Australia each year, 80 per cent of those are men. </p>
<p>A 2009 study found that 15 to 24 year old males in regional areas were 1.5 to 1.8 times more likely to suicide, while the statistics were even worse for men aged 45 to 64.</p>
<p>On average, five men take their life every day with suicide the leading cause of death for men under the age of 44, this significantly exceeds the national road toll.</p>
<p>It's not easy to pinpoint what causes depression and anxiety because it's different for everyone. </p>
<p>Sometimes a difficult time in your or a mate's life can set off depression or anxiety; often it's caused by a combination of issues that have built up over time; and sometimes there's just no explanation.<br /></p>

              New push to tackle workplace stresses that lead to depression

            <div><p>VANCOUVER (NEWS1130) – You probably know someone who has struggled with depression, or have battled with it yourself.</p>
<p>Nations around the world are looking to Canada to lead the way in dealing with stress and anxiety from work that lead to depression. One of these efforts involves a former BC premier who is now Canada’s high commissioner to the UK.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gordon Campbell is hosting a reception for business leaders in Europe. That reception will begin a forum set to head efforts to make workplaces healthier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two mental health advocates — one of whom is also a businessman — are hoping businesses and scientists will come together in our country, in Europe, and in the United States, bringing pilot projects and clinical trials to workplaces.</p>
<p>Those trials and pilot projects would figure out what works, so employers will end up with a kind of guide.</p>
<p>They want a cure for depression, and to see the number of disability claims for anxiety and depression go down to ten percent over the next decade, from between 35 and 45.</p>
<p>Mark Henick with the <a href="http://www.cmha.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Mental Health Association</a> isn’t surprised Canada is being looked at to lead these initiatives, though he says it would have been a surprise ten years ago.</p>
<p>“The work that’s been done through the Mental Health Commission of Canada and through the Canadian Mental Health Association has really been second to none. They deserve — we deserve — the reputation of being world leaders in this regard,” says Henick.</p>
<p>“There have always been really great outstanding programs across Canada that have been making a difference, but what we had always lacked before was the ability to come together and to have an overarching meaning and cause for mental health in Canada. Now we have that, and it’s continuing to develop so mental health is really the ‘it’ cause in Canada right now, and that’s going to continue to grow and that’s going to continue to make a difference.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s great that these kinds of initiatives are finally starting to happen,” he adds. “We know that workplace mental health, especially is one of the most pressing concerns facing Canadian corporations right now. Disability relating to mental health problems is one of the leading costs for companies across Canada.”</p>
<p>“So I think to see, especially in the private sector, people stand up and start to recognize that looking after people’s mental health is more than just a compassionate cause, it’s actually good business. I think that’s really promising to see that happening.”</p>

            <div><p>After a 20-year absence, <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Glenn-Close/">Glenn Close</a> will make her return to Broadway in the new production of <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Edward-Albee/">Edward Albee</a>'s 'A Delicate Balance'. Below, the award-winning actresss stops by this morning's TODAY to talk about her new project!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Glenn-Close/">Glenn Close</a>, <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/John-Lithgow/">John Lithgow</a>, <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Lindsay-Duncan/">Lindsay Duncan</a>,<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Bob-Balaban/">Bob Balaban</a>, <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Clare-Higgins/">Clare Higgins</a>, and <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Martha-Plimpton/">Martha Plimpton</a> will star in a new Broadway production of <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Edward-Albee/">Edward Albee</a>'s <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/A-Delicate-Balance-331008.html">A Delicate Balance</a> this fall at the Golden Theatre (252 West 45th Street). The production, which will be directed by <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Pam-MacKinnon/">Pam MacKinnon</a>, begins previews Monday, October 20 and plays an 18-week limited engagement through Sunday, February 22, 2015. Opening night is Thursday, November 20.</p>
<p>In A DELICATE BALANCE, Agnes (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Glenn-Close/">Glenn Close</a>) and Tobias (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/John-Lithgow/">John Lithgow</a>), a long-married couple, must maintain their equilibrium as over the course of a weekend they welcome home their 36-year-old daughter (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Martha-Plimpton/">Martha Plimpton</a>) after the collapse of her fourth marriage, and give shelter to their best friends (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Bob-Balaban/">Bob Balaban</a> and <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Clare-Higgins/">Clare Higgins</a>), all the while tolerating Agnes' alcoholic sister Claire (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Lindsay-Duncan/">Lindsay Duncan</a>).</p>
<p>A DELICATE BALANCE won <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Edward-Albee/">Edward Albee</a> his first of three Pulitzer Prizes for Drama when it opened on Broadway in 1966. The New York Times has called A DELICATE BALANCE "An evening of theatrical fireworks as ferocious and funny as-and far more humane than-Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf." The Telegraph declared the play "A modern classic with depth, daring, and originality," while The New York Posthas described it as "Brilliantly corroding and laceratingly witty." Time called the play "A haunting parable of disconnection and existential terror," and The Daily News hailed it as "Albee's best and most mature work." In reviewing A DELICATE BALANCE, Variety described the play as "...a deliciously astringent attack on safety and self-satisfaction, an exposure of the responsibilities of living, and a lethal, laugh-out-loud comedy. It is Albee's mature masterpiece."</p>
<p>Tickets, priced from $60 to $155 are available at the <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/John-Golden/">John Golden</a> Theatre box office, on-line at <a href="http://www.telecharge.com/" target="_blank">Telecharge.com</a> or by calling <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/manage_rss/running-shoe/rss/" target="_blank">212.239.6200</a>.</p>

<p>A collaboration is a true privilege and <a href="http://nonnative.com/" target="_blank">nnonative</a> has never taken this opportunity lightly. This can certainly be seen with their latest coyote themed team up with <a href="http://theboombox.com/tags/new-balance/" target="_blank">New Balance</a> that perfectly mimics the look and feel of the prairie wolf.</p><p>The New Balance 710 serves as the base for this collaboration and its hiking build is given a tan long haired suede upper with tonal mesh and leather accents to evoke the feel of the cat’s hide. A vibram outsole would effectively make these your paws and based on the tooling they would probably serve you just as well on the terrain as the actual animal’s would.</p>
<p>These are set to go on sale at select Japanese retailers in limited quantities which means that if you are in the market for something rare it may be time to hunt this coyote.</p>

<p><span>Remember Mario Balotelli's camouflaged Bentley? Well, AC Milan midfielder Sulley Muntari has followed in his former team-mate's footsteps with a camoulaged creation of his own.</span></p><p><span>In a picture posted by Michael Essien on Instagram, the former Chelsea player sits on his Milan team-mates bonnet, showing a Lamborghini with a design very similar to that of Balotelli.</span></p><p><span>Muntari and Balotelli spent a year in each other's company at AC Milan between 2013-2014, before Balotelli left to join Liverpool, and it seems the latter's taste rubbed off on his colleague. </span></p><div><div> <img alt="" src="images/5\5/e5cce1c2c16872d64898c258916fbafa4e736671.jpg" /></div><p>Michael Essien's Instagram post shows Sulley Muntari's garish camouflaged Lamborghini</p></div><div> <div> <img alt="Sulley Muntari celebrates after scoring AC Milan's opening goal in their game against Chievo Verona" src="images/5\5/43ef4e13486d6f462618c6e35b78de8afc404205.jpg" /></div> <p>Sulley Muntari celebrates after scoring AC Milan's opening goal in their game against Chievo Verona</p></div><div> <div> <img alt="Muntari kisses the turf after his goal put Milan 1-0 up at the San Siro stadium on Saturday evening" src="images/5\5/d4eca54b5fd72b713d8d1e05390670a8e99e9be7.jpg" /></div> <p>Muntari kisses the turf after his goal put Milan 1-0 up at the San Siro stadium on Saturday evening</p></div><div><a name="video"></a><div>
</div>
</div><p><span>The Lamborghini is believed to cost between £150,000 and £200,000, an amount that Muntari's €3 million a year contract can easily stretch to.</span></p><p><span>AC Milan have started the season with two wins, two draws and a loss, and currently sit fifth in Serie A.</span></p><p><span>Their only loss came against table-topping Juventus, whose 3-2 victory over Roma at the weekend ensured their 100 per cent record so far this season is still intact. </span></p><p><span>Muntari scored AC Milan's first goal at the weekend, as they eased past Chievo Verona 2-0. </span></p><div><div>

<p>AC Milan are monitoring the progress of West Bromwich Albion full-back Sebastien Pocognoli, reports in Italy suggest.</p>
<p>Sky Sports Italia is reporting that the Belgian is a potential target for the Serie A giants, and they have been impressed with him since his summer move to the Hawthorns.</p>
<p>The 27 year-old joined the Baggies from German side Hannover, and has made an instant impression, winning over the club's fans with his all-action style.</p>
<p>He is currently away on international duty with Belgium.</p>

<p><strong>AC Milan head coach Filippo Inzaghi finally has something to smile about once again, after what has been a rather barren spell for his side in Serie A.</strong><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><a href="http://www.soccer6.co.za/" target="_blank">Predict result and win big with Soccer6</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Milan, who failed to record a win in their three previous fixtures, had dropped as low as fifth in the league standings prior to Saturday’s match against Chievo.</p>
<p>However, the 2-0 victory has helped the Rosonerri move back up to fourth, and Inzaghi is wholly satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<p>"We did very well in attack this evening. They were very closed at the start, I changed the formation, we forced them to open up and this allowed us to play better," Inzaghi told journalists after the game.</p>
<p>The one critical factor for Milan is that they were also sturdy in defence and up to the task when the situation demanded it. As a result the team kept their first clean sheet in five matches.</p>
<p>"Chievo covered well in the first-half. We had two or three chances and we weren’t at risk. We have to improve on certain things, but to be the best attack and to have not conceded a goal is very positive," added Inzaghi.<br /></p>

<p>IN general, men are less likely to talk about depression than women, and tend to put off seeking help because of the stigma surrounding the illness. </p>
<div><img alt="Silence: Mental Health Week 2014 is turning the spotlight on men's reluctance to seek assistance with depression." src="images/7\2/32c2beda0711f90304bb092ee97c6f79c0690a19.gif" /><p>Silence: Mental Health Week 2014 is turning the spotlight on men's reluctance to seek assistance with depression.</p>
</div>
<p>Add to this a lack of access to services in rural and regional areas and suddenly the situation for men in country areas is far worse.</p>
<p>Mental Health Week, October 5 to 12, is designed to highlight this issues surrounding mental health, and the need for more public care and understanding.</p>
<p>It's about trying to change attitudes, such as those of many men who believe they should be tough, self-reliant and able to manage pain. This way of thinking makes it difficult for them to acknowledge when they have any health problems, particularly regarding mental health.</p>
<p>But depression is a serious and common condition that won't just disappear. </p>
<p>According to Beyondblue, often the physical symptoms of depression such as feeling tired or losing weight are more obvious in men.</p>
<p>Depression is common, with one in eight men experiencing it at some stage during their life. </p>
<p>Depression is a high risk factor for suicide with approximately 2200 suicides in Australia each year, 80 per cent of those are men. </p>
<p>A 2009 study found that 15 to 24 year old males in regional areas were 1.5 to 1.8 times more likely to suicide, while the statistics were even worse for men aged 45 to 64.</p>
<p>On average, five men take their life every day with suicide the leading cause of death for men under the age of 44, this significantly exceeds the national road toll.</p>
<p>It's not easy to pinpoint what causes depression and anxiety because it's different for everyone. </p>
<p>Sometimes a difficult time in your or a mate's life can set off depression or anxiety; often it's caused by a combination of issues that have built up over time; and sometimes there's just no explanation.<br /></p>

              New push to tackle workplace stresses that lead to depression
            </h2>
            <!--Articles for keywords "Depression"-->

            <div><p>VANCOUVER (NEWS1130) – You probably know someone who has struggled with depression, or have battled with it yourself.</p>
<p>Nations around the world are looking to Canada to lead the way in dealing with stress and anxiety from work that lead to depression. One of these efforts involves a former BC premier who is now Canada’s high commissioner to the UK.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gordon Campbell is hosting a reception for business leaders in Europe. That reception will begin a forum set to head efforts to make workplaces healthier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two mental health advocates — one of whom is also a businessman — are hoping businesses and scientists will come together in our country, in Europe, and in the United States, bringing pilot projects and clinical trials to workplaces.</p>
<p>Those trials and pilot projects would figure out what works, so employers will end up with a kind of guide.</p>
<p>They want a cure for depression, and to see the number of disability claims for anxiety and depression go down to ten percent over the next decade, from between 35 and 45.</p>
<p>Mark Henick with the <a href="http://www.cmha.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Mental Health Association</a> isn’t surprised Canada is being looked at to lead these initiatives, though he says it would have been a surprise ten years ago.</p>
<p>“The work that’s been done through the Mental Health Commission of Canada and through the Canadian Mental Health Association has really been second to none. They deserve — we deserve — the reputation of being world leaders in this regard,” says Henick.</p>
<p>“There have always been really great outstanding programs across Canada that have been making a difference, but what we had always lacked before was the ability to come together and to have an overarching meaning and cause for mental health in Canada. Now we have that, and it’s continuing to develop so mental health is really the ‘it’ cause in Canada right now, and that’s going to continue to grow and that’s going to continue to make a difference.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s great that these kinds of initiatives are finally starting to happen,” he adds. “We know that workplace mental health, especially is one of the most pressing concerns facing Canadian corporations right now. Disability relating to mental health problems is one of the leading costs for companies across Canada.”</p>
<p>“So I think to see, especially in the private sector, people stand up and start to recognize that looking after people’s mental health is more than just a compassionate cause, it’s actually good business. I think that’s really promising to see that happening.”</p>

            <div><p>After a 20-year absence, <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Glenn-Close/">Glenn Close</a> will make her return to Broadway in the new production of <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Edward-Albee/">Edward Albee</a>'s 'A Delicate Balance'. Below, the award-winning actresss stops by this morning's TODAY to talk about her new project!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Glenn-Close/">Glenn Close</a>, <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/John-Lithgow/">John Lithgow</a>, <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Lindsay-Duncan/">Lindsay Duncan</a>,<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Bob-Balaban/">Bob Balaban</a>, <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Clare-Higgins/">Clare Higgins</a>, and <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Martha-Plimpton/">Martha Plimpton</a> will star in a new Broadway production of <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Edward-Albee/">Edward Albee</a>'s <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/A-Delicate-Balance-331008.html">A Delicate Balance</a> this fall at the Golden Theatre (252 West 45th Street). The production, which will be directed by <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Pam-MacKinnon/">Pam MacKinnon</a>, begins previews Monday, October 20 and plays an 18-week limited engagement through Sunday, February 22, 2015. Opening night is Thursday, November 20.</p>
<p>In A DELICATE BALANCE, Agnes (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Glenn-Close/">Glenn Close</a>) and Tobias (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/John-Lithgow/">John Lithgow</a>), a long-married couple, must maintain their equilibrium as over the course of a weekend they welcome home their 36-year-old daughter (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Martha-Plimpton/">Martha Plimpton</a>) after the collapse of her fourth marriage, and give shelter to their best friends (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Bob-Balaban/">Bob Balaban</a> and <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Clare-Higgins/">Clare Higgins</a>), all the while tolerating Agnes' alcoholic sister Claire (<a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Lindsay-Duncan/">Lindsay Duncan</a>).</p>
<p>A DELICATE BALANCE won <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Edward-Albee/">Edward Albee</a> his first of three Pulitzer Prizes for Drama when it opened on Broadway in 1966. The New York Times has called A DELICATE BALANCE "An evening of theatrical fireworks as ferocious and funny as-and far more humane than-Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf." The Telegraph declared the play "A modern classic with depth, daring, and originality," while The New York Posthas described it as "Brilliantly corroding and laceratingly witty." Time called the play "A haunting parable of disconnection and existential terror," and The Daily News hailed it as "Albee's best and most mature work." In reviewing A DELICATE BALANCE, Variety described the play as "...a deliciously astringent attack on safety and self-satisfaction, an exposure of the responsibilities of living, and a lethal, laugh-out-loud comedy. It is Albee's mature masterpiece."</p>
<p>Tickets, priced from $60 to $155 are available at the <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/John-Golden/">John Golden</a> Theatre box office, on-line at <a href="http://www.telecharge.com/" target="_blank">Telecharge.com</a> or by calling <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/manage_rss/running-shoe/rss/" target="_blank">212.239.6200</a>.</p>

<p>A collaboration is a true privilege and <a href="http://nonnative.com/" target="_blank">nnonative</a> has never taken this opportunity lightly. This can certainly be seen with their latest coyote themed team up with <a href="http://theboombox.com/tags/new-balance/" target="_blank">New Balance</a> that perfectly mimics the look and feel of the prairie wolf.</p><p>The New Balance 710 serves as the base for this collaboration and its hiking build is given a tan long haired suede upper with tonal mesh and leather accents to evoke the feel of the cat’s hide. A vibram outsole would effectively make these your paws and based on the tooling they would probably serve you just as well on the terrain as the actual animal’s would.</p>
<p>These are set to go on sale at select Japanese retailers in limited quantities which means that if you are in the market for something rare it may be time to hunt this coyote.</p>

<p>AC Milan are monitoring the progress of West Bromwich Albion full-back Sebastien Pocognoli, reports in Italy suggest.</p>
<p>Sky Sports Italia is reporting that the Belgian is a potential target for the Serie A giants, and they have been impressed with him since his summer move to the Hawthorns.</p>
<p>The 27 year-old joined the Baggies from German side Hannover, and has made an instant impression, winning over the club's fans with his all-action style.</p>
<p>He is currently away on international duty with Belgium.</p>

              Inzaghi delighted with victory

<p><strong>AC Milan head coach Filippo Inzaghi finally has something to smile about once again, after what has been a rather barren spell for his side in Serie A.</strong><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><a href="http://www.soccer6.co.za/" target="_blank">Predict result and win big with Soccer6</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Milan, who failed to record a win in their three previous fixtures, had dropped as low as fifth in the league standings prior to Saturday’s match against Chievo.</p>
<p>However, the 2-0 victory has helped the Rosonerri move back up to fourth, and Inzaghi is wholly satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<p>"We did very well in attack this evening. They were very closed at the start, I changed the formation, we forced them to open up and this allowed us to play better," Inzaghi told journalists after the game.</p>
<p>The one critical factor for Milan is that they were also sturdy in defence and up to the task when the situation demanded it. As a result the team kept their first clean sheet in five matches.</p>
<p>"Chievo covered well in the first-half. We had two or three chances and we weren’t at risk. We have to improve on certain things, but to be the best attack and to have not conceded a goal is very positive," added Inzaghi.<br /></p>
